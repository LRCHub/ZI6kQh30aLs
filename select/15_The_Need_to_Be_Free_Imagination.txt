Oh, I have seen the darker side,
And I have felt the rain,
The thunder has gone utterly,
All the fire, all the pain,
All I need is to release this power,
And pledge myself to be,
To break the chain that bound our love,
I feel the need to be free
The angel has upon him now,
I fight for love and dignity,
A glow of light surround this love,
A strap back faithfully,
All I need is to release this power,
And pledge my self to be,
To break the chain that bound our love, ooh...
I feel the need to be free,
To be free, Like the birds in the sky,
The child whimpy cries,
Like the river jordan flows,
A flower are regrowth, to be free
Like the birds in the sky
The child whimpy cries,
Like the river jordan flows,
A flower are regrowth, to be free (free),
Like the birds in the sky,
The child whimpy cries, I feel the need to be free,
Like the birds in the sky,
The child whimpy cries,
Like the river jordan flows,
A flower are regrowth, to be free (free),
Like the birds in the sky,
The child whimpy cries, oooh...
I feel the need to be free.
