Head like a rock spinning round and round
I found it in a hole sitting upside down
You point the finger at me
But I don't believe

Paint me a wish on a velvet sky
You demand the answers but I don't know why
In my mind. no. no.
There is no time

But the little things they make me so happy
All I want to do is live by the sea
The little things they make me so happy
But it's good.
It's good.
It's good to be free

So what would you say if I said to you
It's not in what you say, it's in what you do
You point the finger at me.
But I don't believe

Bring it on home to where we found
My head is like a rock sitting upside down
In my mind.
There is no time.

But the little things they make me so happy
All I want to do is live by the sea
The little things they make me so happy
But it's good.
It's good.
It's good to be free.
But it's good.
It's good.
It's good to be free.
